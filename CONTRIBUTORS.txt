Contributor Agreement and List
##############################


Zwiki Contributor Agreement
===========================
This is the official contributor agreement, version 1, and contributor
list for the Zwiki project. This is to help us ensure:

1. there is a clear audit trail and legal status for the project

2. we are able to remain license-compatible with future versions of other
   free & open-source software packages (eg by updating to newer versions
   of GPL)

3. you get proper credit for your work.

If you have contributed code to Zwiki, please also send a patch which adds
your name to the contributor list below. By doing so you indicate that all
of your commits to ZWiki:

- are free of patent violations or copyright violations, to the best of
  your knowledge.

- are released under the GNU GPL v2 or later; or, under another
  GPL-compatible license (such as ZPL), in which case this must be clearly
  noted; or are public domain.

- may be relicensed under official future versions of their license at the
  Zwiki project leader's discretion. Eg GPL v2 code may be relicensed as
  GPL v3 or later.
