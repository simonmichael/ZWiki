Templates, scripts, styleshees, images for Zwiki's skin. This skin works
in both "standard" and "CMF/Plone" wikis. See also Views.py.

Also some ZMI forms. See Wiki.py.

The wiki-named dtml files like RecentChanges.dtml are snapshots of the
evolving dynamic wiki pages of the same name at zwiki.org. They are used
as helpers by the similarly named page templates (eg recentpages.pt), or
can be installed as editable wiki pages via /setupDtmlPages.
